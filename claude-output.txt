# WebStats.io - Architectural Decisions Documentation

## Project Overview
WebStats.io is a comprehensive speed test web application built with Java Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend, designed to provide professional network performance analysis with statistical reporting.

## Core Architecture Decisions

### 1. Backend Technology Stack

**Java Spring Boot 3.2.0 with Java 17**
- **Decision**: Selected Spring Boot for rapid development and enterprise-grade features
- **Rationale**: 
  - Mature ecosystem with excellent documentation
  - Built-in security, monitoring, and testing capabilities
  - Strong MongoDB integration through Spring Data
  - Robust REST API development framework
  - Easy deployment and scaling options

**MongoDB as Primary Database**
- **Decision**: NoSQL document database for flexible schema and horizontal scaling
- **Rationale**:
  - Speed test data has varying structures (different metrics per test type)
  - Time-series data patterns fit well with document storage
  - Easy to add new metrics without schema migrations
  - Excellent aggregation capabilities for analytics
  - Geographic distribution support for global deployment

### 2. Database Schema Design

**Entity Structure**:
1. **Organization**: Multi-tenant support with subscription plans and usage limits
2. **User**: User management with role-based access control
3. **SpeedTestSession**: Active session tracking for real-time progress monitoring
4. **SpeedTestResult**: Comprehensive test results with nested metrics and statistical summaries

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Embedded Documents**: Used nested classes for metrics to reduce database queries
- **Statistical Aggregation**: Pre-calculated statistics stored with results for fast retrieval
- **Raw Measurements**: Detailed measurement data preserved for advanced analytics
- **Flexible Client Info**: Support for geolocation and connection metadata

### 3. Statistical Analysis Implementation

**Apache Commons Math3**
- **Decision**: Professional mathematical library for statistical calculations
- **Features Implemented**:
  - Multiple runs with median/percentile reporting (95th, 99th percentiles)
  - Standard deviation and confidence intervals
  - Outlier detection using IQR method
  - Stability scoring based on coefficient of variation
  - Jitter calculation for latency measurements

**Statistical Metrics Captured**:
- Mean, Median, Min, Max values
- 95th and 99th percentiles for performance SLA reporting
- Standard deviation for consistency measurement
- Packet loss percentage and jitter for latency quality

### 4. Latency Measurement Strategy

**Multi-faceted Latency Testing**:
- **DNS Lookup Time**: Domain resolution performance
- **TCP Connect Time**: Network layer connectivity speed
- **SSL Handshake Time**: Security protocol overhead (when applicable)
- **First Byte Time**: Application layer response time
- **Ping Measurements**: Multiple ICMP-style tests with jitter calculation
- **Packet Loss Detection**: Network reliability measurement

**Implementation Details**:
- Multiple measurement runs (default: 10) for statistical accuracy
- 100ms intervals between pings to avoid network congestion
- Timeout handling (5 seconds default) for unreliable connections
- Asynchronous execution using CompletableFuture for performance

### 5. Frontend Technology Choices

**Angular 17 with Standalone Components**
- **Decision**: Modern Angular with latest architectural patterns
- **Rationale**:
  - Standalone components reduce bundle size and improve tree-shaking
  - TypeScript provides type safety for complex data structures
  - Excellent tooling and development experience
  - Strong ecosystem for charting and UI components

**ECharts for Data Visualization**
- **Decision**: Selected over Chart.js, D3, and Highcharts after comprehensive analysis
- **Rationale**:
  - **Performance**: Superior handling of large time-series datasets
  - **Features**: Rich interaction capabilities (zoom, pan, data brushing)
  - **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions available
  - **Customization**: Highly configurable for professional dashboards
  - **Mobile Support**: Responsive charts work well on all devices
  - **Open Source**: No licensing costs unlike Highcharts

**Bootstrap 5 for UI Framework**
- **Decision**: CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Benefits**: Responsive design, accessibility features, consistent styling

### 6. Service Layer Architecture

**SpeedTestService - Core Business Logic**:
- Asynchronous test execution using CompletableFuture
- Session-based progress tracking with real-time status updates
- Configurable test parameters (duration, runs, connections)
- Statistical analysis integration
- Result aggregation and time-series data preparation

**Separation of Concerns**:
- **Controllers**: REST API endpoints and request/response handling
- **Services**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Repositories**: Data access layer with MongoDB queries
- **DTOs**: Clean data transfer without exposing internal models

### 7. Real-time Progress Tracking

**Session-Based Architecture**:
- **SpeedTestSession**: Tracks active tests with progress percentage
- **Phase Tracking**: Distinct phases (Latency → Download → Upload → Analysis)
- **Polling Strategy**: Client polls every second for updates
- **Status Management**: Clear state machine (Initializing → Running → Completed/Failed)

**Benefits**:
- User feedback during long-running tests
- Ability to cancel tests in progress
- Error handling and recovery
- Multiple concurrent user support

### 8. API Design Philosophy

**RESTful Design Principles**:
- Resource-based URLs (`/speedtest/start`, `/speedtest/status/{id}`)
- HTTP status codes for proper error handling
- JSON request/response format
- CORS support for frontend integration
- Validation using Bean Validation (JSR-303)

**Async Operation Support**:
- Test initiation returns session ID immediately
- Status polling endpoint for progress monitoring
- Separate endpoints for historical data and analytics

### 9. Data Analytics and Reporting

**Time-Series Data Structure**:
- Optimized for charting with timestamp-value pairs
- Separate series for download, upload, and latency metrics
- Efficient aggregation queries in MongoDB
- Support for date range filtering

**Performance Insights**:
- Statistical summaries for trend analysis
- Percentile reporting for SLA monitoring
- Historical comparisons and baseline establishment
- Geographic performance analysis (when location data available)

### 10. Security Considerations

**Data Protection**:
- No sensitive personal information stored beyond basic user metadata
- IP addresses anonymized for privacy
- Secure HTTP headers and CORS configuration
- Input validation on all endpoints

**Performance Security**:
- Rate limiting through organization subscription plans
- Concurrent test limitations to prevent abuse
- Resource timeout configurations
- Error message sanitization

### 11. Scalability Architecture

**Horizontal Scaling Support**:
